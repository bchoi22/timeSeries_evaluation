# timeSeries_evaluation
Using sliding window techniques to find most similar sections between two time series for a given window size.

Method 1: Using the Genetic algorithm (ga) to evaluate the similarity between 2 time series; 1 file (ga_EucDist.R) is for a given window size and other ga file is for a window size as a hyper parameter 

Method 2: Brute force method to find the most similar sections between 2 time series for a given window size (greed_search_TS.R).
